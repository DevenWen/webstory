webstory
========

MapleStory client built with Phaser, NodeJS and WebSockets


Starting it
========

Start `start all.bat` in the root directory.
Then, open up http://127.0.0.1:8082/ . Have fun xd!

Exporting WZ files
========

You can use my modified HaRepacker to export the XMLs we need (from Base.wz, Character.wz, Map.wz and UI.wz): https://www.mediafire.com/folder/bhkjg5uhgd25m/

Put them in MapleSocket/datafiles directory.
